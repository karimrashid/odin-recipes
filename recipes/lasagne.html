    <p style="color:white ;size: 30px;">This isn't a quick and easy lasagna. This is a slow and divine lasagna. A memorable lasagna. And we have a Simply Recipes reader to thank for it.

        Several months ago a commenter on this site, by the name of "El Cocinero Loco" (The Crazy Cook) left a detailed and delightful lasagna Bolognese recipe in the comments of one of our recipes.
        
        The recipe given was a little incomplete; I had to fill in the blanks by referring to a few cookbooks. But it sounded so good that we just had to try it.
        
        Yes it takes hours, and yes, it is worth it. Mr. Loco's commentary is quite amusing, so I do encourage you to read it (just scroll down the comments below).</p>
